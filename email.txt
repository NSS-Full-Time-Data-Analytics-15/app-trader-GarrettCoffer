Attached is an Excel document with our findings.

Our general recommendations are targeting specific genres -- specifically Catalogs and Books, with a higher average profitability than other groupings.
(See Excel tab 3A_genre and 3A_price_range for comparison data, and note how the genre is generally more reliable than the price range for average calculated profitability.)

We recommend these 10 apps based on the criteria of the greatest total projected profit over the lifetime of the app.  They are listed in both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, so advertising can be focused more generally instead of targeting a specific app store market.  The average projected lifetime profit is around $1,100,000.
